# py4cytoscape

This project recreates the [R-based RCy3 Cytoscape Automation library](https://github.com/cytoscape/RCy3) as a Python package. The idea is to allow a Cytoscape workflow to be written in one language (R or Python) and translated to another language (Python or R) without having to learn different Cytoscape interfaces. The current Cytoscape Python interface ([Py2Cytoscape](https://github.com/cytoscape/py2cytoscape)) has different features than the Cytoscape R library, and therefore doesn't fit my purpose.

Additionally, this project attempts to maintain the same function signatures, return values, function implementation and module structure as the RCy3, thereby enabling smooth maintenance and evolution of both RCy3 and py4cytoscape.

This project uses PyCharm because of its excellent code management and debugging features.

Over time, py4cytoscape functionality should match RCy3 functionality. Once that occurs, novel Py2Cytoscape functions will be added to both as appropriate.

An overall scorecard comparing Py2Cytoscape, RCy3 and py4cytoscape can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uhBTbOMI4QMKUpLaOTuf6BP5wgqU6-pOzkj6BNmC4CY/edit?usp=sharing). Pay close attention to columns E and F, which show how much of RCy3 is reflected in py4cytoscape.

You can try ``py4cytoscape`` with a web browser only, without installing anything in your local environment.

## How to configure logging

py4cytoscape logging is based on the Python ``logging`` package, which is based on ``JUnit``.
