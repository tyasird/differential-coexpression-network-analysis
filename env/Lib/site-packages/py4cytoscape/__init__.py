# https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html

# TODO: Remember to set __all__ to enumerate what modules are exported from this package. Do this at the module level, too, for functions ... consider using a decorator to fill the __all__ per https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44834/can-someone-explain-all-in-python
# TODO: Add type hints per https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/ for all functions

# TODO: Remember to execute pylint: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38134086/how-to-run-pylint-with-pycharm

# Note that use of "import" statement project wide per advice of:
